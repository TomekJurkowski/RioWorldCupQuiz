To win the quiz and 'receive the trophy' you have to answer 21 questions correctly:
- first 12 questions are resonably easy - it is called the 'Elimination phase'
- next 5 questions are quite difficult - this is the 'Group phase'
- last 4 questions are extremely difficult and require a great knowledge - this are the 'Playoffs'

You have 45 seconds to answer every question, however the sooner you answer the more points you will gather.
Maximum number of points for each question:
1st question - 45
2nd question - 45*2
3rd question - 45*3
...
21st question - 45*21
Every second passed reduces the number of points to be collected by 1/45 
There are additional bonus points for answering correctly the 12th (400 points), 17th(600 points) and the 21st(800 points) questions.

Question consists of 4 options, one of which is correct and the rest are wrong.

There are 4 lifelines you might use (each one only once):
* 'Yellow Card' - throws away one wrong answer
* 'Red Card' - throws away two wrong answers
* 'Ask Expert' - you ask for help one of the experts. There are 3 experts: Analyst, Coach and Player.
  Each one of them is good in his own field of expertise:
    Analyst - statistics,
    Coach - questions about previous tournaments,
    Player - modern history of the World Cup
* 'Ask Football Fans'

'Yellow Card' and 'Red Card' always throw away wrong answers, however the next two lifelines
do not always give you a correct answer. The chances that the prompt you get is correct are
95% in 'Elimination phase', 75% in 'Group phase' and 55% in 'Playoffs'. Additionally, when using
the expert's help, if you choose an expert whose field of expertise has a little to do with the question
the chances that he will answer correctly are reduced by 20%.
